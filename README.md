# BioWare Forum Readability Fix

This is a quick fix the improve the readability of the [BioWare Forum][BSN], which was completely redesigned on 2014-02-24. It increases the font size for text meant to be read and changes some colours to improve contrast. It is not a theme changer.

## Installation

It is recommended to install the file from [userstyles.org][CSS] to better facilitate updating.

## Support

Officially, only the latest stable version of Firefox is supported. Several other major browsers have support for similar functionality, and Stylish exists in a Google Chrome version.

### Dependencies

* [Stylish][] 1.4.1+
