# BioWare Forum Fixes

These user scripts improve the usability of the [BioWare Forum][BSN]. The style
sheet aims to improve overall readability of the white theme while the script
improves functionality such as navigation. See the respective sites for a
feature overview; it won't be included here for maintenance reasons.

## Installation

It is recommended to install the files from [userstyles.org][CSS] respectively
[userscripts.org][JS] to better facilitate updating.

## Support

Officially, only the latest stable version of Firefox is supported. Several
other major browsers have support for similar functionality, and Stylish exists
in a Google Chrome version.

### Dependencies
